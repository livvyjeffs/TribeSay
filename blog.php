                       <div class="text-content"><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Welcome to TribeSay’s very first blog post! </span><span class="c0">This blog will act as direct communication to the userbase as a whole. Here, you will be able to find explanations of new features, updates about the website and its team, and</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">important</span><span class="c0"> things to come for TribeSay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">Introducing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">TribeSay</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">TribeSay is a crowd-curated social news platform. Anybody has the ability to post, but it’s up to other users to vote on what becomes popular and trending. Taking into account a post’s recentness and vote count, it is ranked among other TribeSay posts in order to set its place on the frontpage of the website. In other words, the more recent a post is and the more votes that it has garnered, the higher it will be featured on the frontpage. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">TribeSay’s Mission</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">TribeSay aims to create a completely democratic and decentralized source of news for users. With that in mind, we seek to separate news production and distribution in order to eliminate biased opinions and corporate influence which is rampant throughout traditional news outlets. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reddit pioneered the idea of a social news platform but has gradually become a community and website primarily for the tech-savvy. &nbsp;TribeSay strives to create a platform that &nbsp;is easy to use and friendly to all demographics. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c1">What do we have planned for TribeSay?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><ul class="c10 lst-kix_j0yey8cclmge-0 start"><li class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c1">FounderFest! </span><span class="c0">FounderFest is a soiree</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">being held by TribeSay in the Washington DC area specifically for startups. Startups and their teams are constantly working to create their products and services, so isn’t it about time that we all come together and have a good time? More information and tickets for FounderFest can be found </span><span class="c7 c0"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventbrite.com%2Fe%2Ffounderfest-tickets-12107853917&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH69NfJppf1vsfFCigaJABd91kahw">here</a></span><span class="c0">. </span></li><li class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c1">Content Creator Dashboard! </span><span class="c0">We realize that TribeSay may become controversial in the sense that it rehosts content from other websites. We are continually working with legal advisors and content creators to create solutions for this issue. Currently, creators have the ability to choose from any of these options:</span></li></ul><ol class="c10 lst-kix_j0yey8cclmge-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">Revenue share. Original providers of work will be able to claim a portion of TribeSay’s income as a payment for scraped work.</span></li><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">Tipping mechanism. Users will be able to tip, or donate, to pieces of work that they like which will go directly to the original source. This function will possibly support Bitcoin tipping as well.</span></li><li class="c3 c6"><span class="c0">DMCA Takedown Request</span><span class="c0">. If a content creator does not want a piece of their work to be posted on TribeSay, </span><span class="c0">they have the ability to put in a takedown request and it will be expediently removed.</span></li></ol><ul class="c10 lst-kix_j0yey8cclmge-0"><li class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c1">iOS App Creation!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;TribeSay is planning on releasing its very first mobile application in the near future. While only the iOS platform will be supported at first, Android will be available soon after. </span></li><li class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c1">Sponsorships! </span><span class="c0">TribeSay’s current sponsor is Grilled Cheese DC, a grilled cheese bar located in the heart of Washington DC. You can visit their website </span><span class="c0 c7"><a class="c8" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grilledcheesedc.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKeMilEiki821jJIPcCcs7kRHK4A">here</a></span><span class="c0">.
